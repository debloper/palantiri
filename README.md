# Palantíri
### A generic, opensource, event/activity tracking portal
A ***[palantír](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palant%C3%ADr)*** (**pl.** ***palantíri***) is a magical artifact from **The Middle Earth**. A Quenya word, which literally translates to "Farsighted" or "One that Sees from Afar", it is a spherical stone that functions somewhat like a crystal ball.

In our context, this project strives to be used as activity tracking portals - for projects, communities and so on - which fairly resembles tracking remote actions from one consolidated portal. Hence, they are the Palantíri.

From the legendarium, there supposed to be seven of them, but what the heck - deploy yours!
